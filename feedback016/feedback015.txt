Great mag, reminds me why I was drawn to Linux in the first place now that other mags are all fading.

Thank you very much for your amazing work ! It reminds me when I was using the ZX81 way back and reading the magazines we had in France then...

I've already connected the RaspberryPi to our TV set and my 8 years old son is having a blast creating Scratch sprites and having them move around and change colors when they hit each other.

I'm trying to teach him new tricks once in a while and I'm having some fun too !

The most interesting thing – the stonework in the background of the rather
splendid picture of the author (ladies, form an orderly queue), is the
southern pier of Ironbridge, nr Telford, the first, er, Iron Bridge.

Wrote my first Python game tonight, courtesy of @TheMagP1. By which I mean, I copied the code out of the magazine.
